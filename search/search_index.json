The most basic agent, which is common to all models, is the person. Such person-agents are often described with attributes such as age, gender, race, and work status. Even with a crude representation of independent persons, a categorically different understanding of the impacts of urban policy proposals is possible relative to aggregate demand or mean-value models. Additional attributes may be added to increase diversity of representation or aid analysis. The opportunity exists to add detailed information for specific analyses such as disability, possession of a driver license, or even attitudinal preferences. Extending the relationships between these person-agents through additional decision-making agents such as households, neighborhoods, jobs, social organizations, firms, and even mobility operators \u2013 each with their own array of attributes, behaviors, and goals \u2013 can enable more in-depth or informative analysis.</p> <p>Another continuum exists for the activities in which the agents participate, as well as their locations and times. At its most basic level, modeling individuals participating in at-home, work, school, and other activities provides a framework for understanding basic but important questions of time use, engagement with employment and education, and the wider economy. Shopping activities could be left as simply shopping activities, or disaggregated into grocery, clothing, white goods, and other kinds of shopping. Further disaggregation of these activity types into full- and part-time work periods, escorting household members to other activities, various types of recreational activity, etc. can more realistically represent the variety of human behaviors.</p> <p>Activity and agent locations might be described using zone systems from traditional spatial models, smaller micro-zones, or even by specific coordinates in space. There is also a continuum in the extent to which the locations are characterised, ranging from attributes such as geographical location (zone id, centrality, point coordinates etc) to the variety of goods and services available at the location. Activities interact with locations in important ways; while many activities must occur at specific locations (e.g. home and work activities), some could occur at any location with appropriate services (a shopping activity at a set of suitable stores), and others might occur anywhere (digital activities).</p> <p>Times may be represented as a series of time periods (morning peak, mid-day, etc. ) or as a continuous timeline, and provides a framework for determining the timing and duration of agents\u2019 activities over a day, week, month or even a year. Agents ought not participate in multiple activities at multiple locations simultaneously.</p> <p>The desired specificity in all of these elements should reflect the desired sensitivity of the policies under study and the data availability. Increased sensitivity in representation in turn enables more sensitive policy analysis on a wide range of potential issues. At the same time, it should be stressed that even the most basic activity-based models \u2013 those with the most rudimentary concepts of agents, activities, locations, and time \u2013 can generate a categorically different understanding of the demand for infrastructure networks than the aggregate demand models of previous eras. They enable the person agents to respond to changes in infrastructure networks, associated resources and policies in a method that can be intuitively described and tested, rather than simply measured as an aggregate change. Through the following examples, we illustrate the value of this distinction in several sectors.</p>"},{"location":"elements-of-abms/","title":"Elements of Activity Based Models","text":""},{"location":"elements-of-abms/#core-vs-extensions-for-different-sectors","title":"Core vs Extensions for Different Sectors","text":"<p>The core framework of an activity-based approach puts human needs and the resulting activities at the centre. And depending on where in the above continuum the model is developed, the activity-based model can be used to address questions such as What are the potential impacts of price signals on the timing and scheduling of consumption activities? (this could apply to energy or transport or any other resource) Appropriate characterisation and modelling of the \u2018time\u2019 component of human activities can address this question.</p> <p>How do personal and social networks impact individual activity patterns and what are the implications of this for resource consumption and wellbeing? This will require appropriate characterisation and modelling of the \u2018agent\u2019 component in a manner that allows for interactions between them.</p> <p>In order to analyse the impacts of a specific policy, or the impacts of a scenario on a specific infrastructure system(s), the activity-based model must be extended beyond this core to incorporate the necessary infrastructure components and variables that can link human activities to the infrastructure and the wider system. The resulting model can then translate human activities to demand for the relevant resources that will be manifested on the corresponding supply/infrastructure networks to determine the system-wide impacts. For instance, if the objective is to analyse the air quality, equity and energy system impacts of a policy targeting large scale electrification of road vehicle fleets, the activity-based model must be extended to include a transport systems component and an energy systems component, and it must represent agents at a level where in-depth equity analysis can be undertaken.</p> <p>In this manner, extensions of the activity-based model can be developed to address a wide range of policy questions. For example,</p> <ul> <li>What are the impacts of air pollution on mortality or disease status, and what are the key contributors to this? This can be determined by evaluating the health exposures of agents over the course of the day or week, not only during transport but also while performing activities (e.g. physical activity while cycling, noise pollution at home or air pollution at school). Accordingly, this will require an additional component that can translate exposures over a long period into health implications.</li> <li>How will epidemics spread through a community? This can be achieved by linking the model of human activity with travel patterns on transport network, and extending it further to model how diseases spread with exposure in different conditions while traveling and at the destinations.</li> <li>To what extent can electric vehicles support renewables in the electricity generation mix, with the use of vehicle to grid technology?</li> </ul> <p>Figure 1 illustrates how the core activity-based model can be extended to consider different infrastructures or combinations of infrastructures, thus supporting more comprehensive appraisals of policies that impact multiple integrated infrastructures. Suggestions for what these extensions may comprise follow.</p> <p></p> <p>Transport extension: this could go into more detail about transport mode and route choice, and might include goods and services delivered to the home (e.g. parcel deliveries and home care) in lieu of shopping trips, or perhaps in addition to shopping trips that are now used to scope out the available products in the market so that more targeted trips to specific shops will suffice. Compared to the traditional trip and tour-based paradigms used for transport planning and policy, this would enable in-home/ out-of-home activity trade-offs to be considered, as well as trip consolidation through multiple activities being carried out at the same location (e.g. a mall with shops, cinemas, restaurants etc). Induced demand could also be considered, as response to decreased congestion or increased access. This is explored further in Part Two.</p> <p>Health extension: this could develop in several ways. First, by knowing the duration of time spent at different locations, and while travelling, it becomes possible to estimate better rates of exposure to health-harming conditions, such as air and noise pollution, or risk of collisions, or crime exposure. Second, health benefits of physical activity can be attributed to various travel and non-travel activities. Third, mental health benefits could be estimated, by measuring time spent out of doors, in green and blue spaces, and socially interacting with others.</p> <p>Energy extension: this could focus on identifying energy consumption associated with the facilities used to undertake activities including lighting, heating, cooking and the use of machinery and devices, to assess overall energy demand profiles. By determining the fuel source of the energy used (including the prime source of electricity generation), it then becomes possible to estimate total carbon emissions and \u2013 by auditing the use of facilities and tools \u2013 to include the embedded carbon used in their construction. It also provides opportunities to look at trade-offs between sectors; for example, is it less energy intensive to work from home or travel to work, taking all sources of emissions into account. The energy extension could also explicitly link transport and energy infrastructures by introducing charging infrastructure and networks that represent the electricity demand generated from the charging and discharging activities of electric vehicle \u2018agents\u2019.</p> <p>Other Extensions are also possible, including:</p> <ul> <li>Identifying other types of resource consumption associated with activity patterns (e.g. water, wastes)</li> <li>Measuring consumer expenditure patterns - Identifying wider impacts of digitisation on daily/weekly activity patterns   \u00b7 - Examining the (currently unrecognised) impacts of decisions taken in one sector, on others \u2013 for example...</li> </ul> <p>...table...</p>"},{"location":"for-modelers/","title":"But I like my four-step model!","text":"<p>We will fix that.</p>"},{"location":"for-modelers/#whats-wrong-with-your-model","title":"What's wrong with your model","text":"<p>...</p>"},{"location":"for-modelers/#what-to-do-about-it","title":"What to do about it","text":"<p>...</p>"},{"location":"the-manifesto/","title":"The Manifesto","text":"<p>The Activity Based Modeling Manifesto: a Call to Action: \"Adopting an activity-based paradigm in order to better address the resource challenges faced by societies.\"</p>"},{"location":"the-manifesto/#policy-challenge","title":"Policy Challenge","text":"<p>Cities face a growing range and severity of problems, which current ways of thinking and analysis have not only failed to resolve, but in some cases have made the problems worse. For example, imposing regulation or pricing to reduce air quality problems in city centres without providing alternate public transport options can have negative distributional impacts on vulnerable segments of the population. Policies aimed at the rapid electrification of vehicle fleets without consideration of whether the electricity network infrastructure can handle the sudden increase in demand pose the danger of bringing down the electricity network. Investments in vehicles transport networks without consideration of exposure to vehicle emissions and reduced physical activity will have a negative impact on public health and wellbeing. In order to address such complex problems it is necessary to be able to predict a wide range of system-level consequences that arise from human activities and policy interventions, including air pollution, carbon consumption, disease spread, traffic congestion, collisions, land development, and social inequities. This calls for a fresh approach that embodies systems thinking and embraces the complexity of human behaviour to identify the direct and indirect impacts of a wide range of policies on the integrated infrastructures that societies rely on: transport, electricity, healthcare, water, wastes, and many others.</p>"},{"location":"the-manifesto/#the-need-for-a-better-way-of-thinking","title":"The Need for a Better Way of Thinking","text":"<p>We argue that meeting these challenges requires the engagement of both policy makers and scientists, and that society needs a structured way of systems-level thinking to facilitate the conversation between those groups.

In this context, they are used to predict the trips that occur between activities at different locations, as a derived demand from the desire to participate in those activities. Analysts use these models to predict the effects of proposed infrastructure projects, policies and changes of the environment and inform decisions about those investments.
