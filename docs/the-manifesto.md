# The Manifesto

Activity Based Modeling Manifesto – a Call to Action: ‘Adopting an activity-based paradigm in order to better address the resource challenges faced by societies’.

### Policy Challenge

Cities face a growing range and severity of problems, which current ways of thinking and analysis have not only failed to resolve, but in some cases have made the problems worse. For example, imposing regulation or pricing to reduce air quality problems in city centres without providing alternate public transport options can have negative distributional impacts on vulnerable segments of the population. Policies aimed at the rapid electrification of vehicle fleets without consideration of whether the electricity network infrastructure can handle the sudden increase in demand pose the danger of bringing down the electricity network. Investments in public transport networks without consideration of exposure to viruses and germs will have a negative impact on public health and wellbeing.

In order to address such complex problems it is necessary to be able to predict a wide range of system-level consequences that arise from human activities and policy interventions, including air pollution, carbon consumption, disease spread, traffic congestion, collisions, land development, and social inequities. This calls for a fresh approach that embodies systems thinking and embraces the complexity of human behaviour to identify the direct and indirect impacts of a wide range of policies on the integrated infrastructures that societies rely on: transport, electricity, health, water, wastes, and many others.

## ABM Paradigm as a Solution <br/> The Need for a New Way of Thinking

We argue that meeting these challenges requires the engagement of both policy makers and scientists, and that society needs a structured way of systems-level thinking to facilitate the conversation between those groups. We propose the Activity-Based Modeling (ABM) paradigm as the approach to doing so, and urge both the scientific and policy communities to embrace this paradigm.

While there are several possible systems thinking approaches to framing and modelling integrated urban infrastructures and their operations, we contend that an activity-based paradigm is well suited to meeting this challenge, from a consumer demand perspective, for a number of reasons:

- It encompasses all aspects of human behaviour, so providing a comprehensive basis for exploring the causes and consequences of changes in lifestyles and behaviour, and the associated uses of facilities and resources.

- Since activities represent the basis on which individual needs and wants, and societal roles, are fulfilled, the basic drivers of behaviour are directly captured in daily activity patterns, and many aspects of well-being can be addressed.

- As it adopts a system-wide perspective, the activity-based paradigm captures the opportunities, trade-offs and constraints faced by households and individuals, so that secondary impacts can be identified and traced through the system.

- This also provides a common analytical framework that can help to co-ordinate actions across a range of city departments and other agencies, and provide a basis for holistic appraisal.

- It provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and analysing travel behaviour, including trade-offs between in-home and out-of-home activities, the myriad of ways in which non-home activities can be met at a variety of non-home facilities and sites (including during travel) and the influence of intra-household interdependencies.

- Thus, the primary focus of policy switches from providing mobility – with the implicit assumption that facilitating‘ more (and longer?) travel is better’ - to an emphasis on providing access to activities and associated goods and services; this access might be digital or physical, and locally or at a greater distance, as appropriate. Now, in some situations, ‘less can be more’.

- Similarly, the public health and well-being consequences of behaviour change can be more fully assessed in their various forms, including physical activity, exposure to air pollution, etc. and extent of social networks.

- All activities consume resources of various kinds; for example, electricity, water, money budgets. If these are tagged to each activity, then it becomes possible to predict changes in aggregate resource use associated with revisions to activity/travel patterns.

- Collectively, this more comprehensive approach to analysing behaviour and its wide ranging consequences, provides a much richer basis for both modelling and appraisal.

- More fundamentally, the activity-based paradigm provides a new way of **thinking **about behaviour and lifestyles – a new perspective that will help to trigger new solutions to tackling urgent societal problems.

- The activity-based paradigm combined with a microsimulation-based implementation (which is the most common implementation methodology to date, for activity-based models) allows this level of complexity in human behaviour, and the associated consumption vectors, to be practically modelled, even for very large urban areas.
