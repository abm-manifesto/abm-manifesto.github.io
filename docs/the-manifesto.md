# The Manifesto

**The Activity Based Modeling Manifesto:** a Call to Action: "Adopting an activity-based paradigm in order to better address the resource challenges faced by societies."

### Policy Challenge

Cities face a growing range and severity of problems, which current ways of thinking and analysis have not only failed to resolve, but in some cases have made the problems worse. For example, imposing regulation or pricing to reduce air quality problems in city centres without providing alternate public transport options can have negative distributional impacts on vulnerable segments of the population. Policies aimed at the rapid electrification of vehicle fleets without consideration of whether the electricity network infrastructure can handle the sudden increase in demand pose the danger of bringing down the electricity network. Investments in vehicles transport networks without consideration of exposure to vehicle emissions and reduced physical activity will have a negative impact on public health and wellbeing.
In order to address such complex problems it is necessary to be able to predict a wide range of system-level consequences that arise from human activities and policy interventions, including air pollution, carbon consumption, disease spread, traffic congestion, collisions, land development, and social inequities. This calls for a fresh approach that embodies systems thinking and embraces the complexity of human behaviour to identify the direct and indirect impacts of a wide range of policies on the integrated infrastructures that societies rely on: transport, electricity, healthcare, water, wastes, and many others.

### The Need for a Better Way of Thinking

We argue that meeting these challenges requires the engagement of both policy makers and scientists, and that society needs a structured way of systems-level thinking to facilitate the conversation between those groups. We propose an activity-based paradigm as the approach to doing so, and urge both the scientific and policy communities to embrace this paradigm.

- At its core, this paradigm requires that analysts considers:
- The behavior of decision-making **agents**. These agents may include people, households, vehicles, buildings, firms, and others.
- The **activities** in which each agent participates. For people, these activities may include working, shopping, socializing, sleeping, or other actions that fulfill the person’s needs, wants and roles.
- The **location** at which each activity occurs.
- The **time** at which each activity occurs.
- The interaction of the above elements with an **infrastructure network**, as well as associated resources and policies.

Taken together, these five elements provide a framework that is both simple to explain and powerful in its capacity to provide insight into the workings of inter-connected systems in several domains. While there are several possible systems thinking approaches to framing and modelling integrated urban infrastructures and their operations, we contend that an activity-based paradigm is better suited to meeting the challenges faced by modern society.

This paradigm is often operationalized in the form of computer simulations, known as Activity Based Models (ABMs), which have been used most extensively within the transport sector. In this context, they are used to predict the trips that occur between activities at different locations, as a derived demand from the desire to participate in those activities. Analysts use these models to predict the effects of proposed infrastructure projects, policies and changes of the environment and inform decisions about those investments.
Analysts use these models to consider the impacts of infrastructure and resource policies on agent behavior.

In a transport context, This framework allows the cost of personal trips – both to the user and to society in the form of congestion, emissions and noise – to be weighed against the value of participating in activities. ABMs can also provide the framework to understand the demands imposed by these trips and activities on other sectors, such as electrical and water networks. a means of understanding peoples’ exposure to health risks within their environment, and how their activities relate to consumer spending and therefore the economy.
