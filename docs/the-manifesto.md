**A Call to Action: Adopting an activity-based paradigm in order to better address the resource challenges faced by societies**

## Policy Challenge

Cities face a growing range and severity of problems, which current ways of thinking and analysis have not only failed to resolve, but in some cases have made the problems worse. For example, imposing regulation or pricing to reduce air quality problems in city centres without providing alternate public transport options can have negative distributional impacts on vulnerable segments of the population. Policies aimed at the rapid electrification of vehicle fleets without consideration of whether the electricity network infrastructure can handle the sudden increase in demand pose the danger of bringing down the electricity network. Investments in public transport networks without consideration of exposure to viruses and germs will have a negative impact on public health and wellbeing.

In order to address such complex problems it is necessary to be able to predict a wide range of system-level consequences that arise from human activities, including air pollution, carbon consumption, disease spread, congestion, collisions, and social inequities. This calls for a fresh approach that embodies systems thinking and embraces the complexity of human behaviour to identify the direct and indirect impacts of a wide range of policies on the integrated infrastructures that societies rely on (transport, electricity, health, water, wastes).
